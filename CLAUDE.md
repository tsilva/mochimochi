# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**mochi-mochi** is a Python CLI tool for managing Mochi flashcards via the Mochi API. It provides CRUD operations and AI-powered grading using OpenRouter's Gemini 2.5 Flash model.

## Documentation Philosophy

**This is a small, focused CLI tool (< 400 lines).** Keep all documentation consolidated in README.md and this file. Do not create additional .md files (summaries, migration guides, completion reports, etc.) unless explicitly requested by the user. Over-documentation creates maintenance burden for small projects.

## Development Commands

### Running the CLI
```bash
# Direct execution
python main.py <command>

# Or install and use entry point
uv sync
mochi-cards <command>
```

### Available Commands

**Core Sync Workflow**:
```bash
python main.py pull                          # Pull cards from remote, merge with local
python main.py status                        # Show local changes not yet pushed
python main.py push                          # Push local changes to remote
python main.py push --force                  # Push without duplicate detection
```

**Local Operations**:
```bash
python main.py grade --batch-size 20         # Grade cards in local file using LLM
```

**Discovery** (doesn't require DECK_ID):
```bash
python main.py decks                         # List all decks (only needs API_KEY)
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Install with dev dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run all unit tests (skip integration tests)
pytest -m "not integration"

# Run all tests including integration tests (requires TEST_DECK_ID env var)
TEST_DECK_ID=your_deck_id pytest

# Run specific test class
pytest test_main.py::TestParseCard -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=main --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Dependencies
```bash
# Install in development mode
uv sync --extra dev

# Runtime dependencies:
# - requests>=2.25.0
# - python-dotenv>=0.19.0

# Dev dependencies:
# - pytest>=7.0.0
# - pytest-mock>=3.10.0
```

## Configuration

The tool requires a `.env` file with:
```
MOCHI_API_KEY=your_mochi_api_key
DECK_ID=your_deck_id
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key  # Only for grading feature
```

All operations work on the single deck specified by `DECK_ID`.

## Architecture

### Single-File Structure
All code is in `main.py` - a single Python module with no subdirectories or packages.
Tests are in `test_main.py` using pytest framework.

### Sync-Based Workflow (Local-First Model)

The tool now operates on a **local-first sync model**:

1. **Local Working Copy**: `mochi_cards.md` - your editable deck file
2. **Sync State**: `.mochi_sync/` directory tracks sync state
   - `last_sync.md` - snapshot from last successful sync (enables three-way merge)
   - `deleted.txt` - tracks deletions for proper sync
3. **Workflow**: `pull` → edit locally (manual or via `grade`) → `push`

**Benefits**:
- Easy backup/restore (just copy `mochi_cards.md`)
- Manual editing supported (edit markdown directly)
- Version control friendly (track deck changes in git)
- LLM operations work offline on local copy
- Duplicate detection prevents card duplication

**Three-Way Merge**: When you `pull`, the tool compares:
- Base state (last sync)
- Local changes (your edits)
- Remote changes (Mochi updates)

This ensures local and remote changes merge correctly, with conflicts defaulting to local changes.

### Error Handling Philosophy
**Fail fast.** The codebase intentionally avoids defensive error handling that swallows exceptions or provides defaults. Let exceptions propagate to the top rather than catching and continuing. This makes debugging easier and prevents silent failures.

### Core Functions

**Sync Operations**:
- **`pull(deck_id)`**: Pull cards from remote and merge with local using three-way merge
- **`push(deck_id, force=False)`**: Push local changes to remote with duplicate detection
- **`status()`**: Show diff between local and last sync state

**Utility Functions**:
- **`parse_card(content)`**: Parse card content into (question, answer) tuple
- **`content_hash(question, answer)`**: Generate hash for duplicate detection
- **`parse_markdown_cards(markdown_text)`**: Parse markdown file into card dicts with metadata
- **`format_card_to_markdown(card)`**: Format card dict to markdown with frontmatter
- **`ensure_sync_dir()`**: Create .mochi_sync directory and update .gitignore
- **`get_decks()`**: Fetch all decks from Mochi API
- **`find_deck(decks, deck_name, deck_id)`**: Find deck by name (partial match) or ID

**Local Operations**:
- **`grade_local_cards(batch_size=20)`**: Grade cards from local file using LLM

**API Operations** (used internally by sync):
- **`get_cards(deck_id, limit=100)`**: Paginated card fetching
- **`create_card(deck_id, content, **kwargs)`**: Create new cards
- **`update_card(card_id, **kwargs)`**: Update existing cards
- **`delete_card(card_id)`**: Delete cards
- **`grade_cards_batch(cards_batch)`**: Grade multiple cards in a single LLM API call

### Card Format

**Internal API Format:**
Cards use markdown with `---` separator:
```
Question text
---
Answer text
```

**Local File Format** (`mochi_cards.md`):
Clean markdown with frontmatter for metadata (no header):
```markdown
---
card_id: abc123
tags: ["python", "basics"]
archived: false
---
Question text
---
Answer text
---
card_id: null
---
New question
---
New answer
```

**Frontmatter Fields**:
- `card_id`: Mochi card ID (or `null` for new cards)
- `tags`: JSON array of tags (optional)
- `archived`: Boolean flag for archived cards (optional, only included if `true`)

**Sync Behavior**:
- Cards with valid IDs → updated on `push`
- Cards with `card_id: null` → created as new cards on `push`
- Duplicate detection uses content hash (question + answer)

### LLM Grading System
- Uses OpenRouter API with Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- Batches multiple cards per API call (default: 20) to minimize costs
- Returns JSON-formatted grades with scores (0-10) and justifications

### Single Deck Model
The CLI operates on a single deck specified by `DECK_ID` in `.env`. The workflow is:
1. `pull` to download the deck to `mochi_cards.md`
2. Edit locally (manually or via `grade`)
3. `push` to upload changes back to Mochi

### Testing Architecture
- **Unit Tests**: Test utilities (parse_card, find_deck) and CLI parsing with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`, test live API operations
- **Mocking**: Uses `unittest.mock` and `pytest-mock` for external API calls
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data (sample_decks, sample_cards) defined in test_main.py
- **Test Organization**: Tests grouped by functionality in classes (TestParseCard, TestFindDeck, TestCRUDOperations, etc.)

Integration tests require `TEST_DECK_ID` environment variable and are skipped by default.

## Entry Point
The package is configured in `pyproject.toml` with the entry point `mochi-cards` pointing to `main:main`.
