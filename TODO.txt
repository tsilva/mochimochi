- measure card answer accuracy
- detect duplicates (exact match and similar)
- detect missing cards, sort cards by semantic similarity and search for cards that could be added to fill in the gaps
- upload feature should also work for updates if card is is specified
- make most tasks work around the concept of a scratchpad; basically all tasks dump output to a file that can then still be iterated by human, and then human can upload that file using the upload feature
