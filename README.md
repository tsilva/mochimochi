## 🔑 Configuration

On first run, you'll be prompted for your Mochi API key (get it from [settings](https://app.mochi.cards/settings)). It's saved to `~/.mochi-mochi/config` automatically.

Or create the config manually:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.mochi-mochi
echo "MOCHI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > ~/.mochi-mochi/config
```

---

## 💻 Usage

**Workflow:** List decks → Pull → Edit → Commit → Push

```bash
mochi-mochi decks                        # List all decks
mochi-mochi pull <deck_id>               # Download deck to <name>-<id>.md
mochi-mochi push <deck-file>.md          # Sync changes to Mochi
mochi-mochi push <deck-file>.md --force  # Push without duplicate detection
```

**Managing multiple decks:**
```bash
mkdir ~/my-flashcards && cd ~/my-flashcards && git init
mochi-mochi pull abc123 && mochi-mochi pull def456
git add . && git commit -m "Initial decks"
# Edit files, commit, then push individual decks as needed
```

## 📝 Card Format

Cards are markdown with frontmatter, separated by `---`:

```markdown
---
card_id: abc123
tags: ["python", "basics"]
---
What is a list comprehension?
---
A concise way to create lists in Python using [x for x in iterable]
---
card_id: null
---
What is a dictionary?
---
A key-value data structure
```

**Frontmatter fields:**
- `card_id`: Mochi ID (`null` for new cards)
- `tags`: JSON array (optional)
- `archived`: Set to `true` to archive (optional)

**Sync behavior:**
- Existing cards (with IDs) are updated
- New cards (`card_id: null`) are created
- Duplicate detection prevents copies (use `--force` to bypass)
