## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (takes 5 seconds)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/tsilva/mochi-mochi.git

# 2. First run will ask for your API key
mochi-mochi decks

# 3. Pull a deck to curate
mochi-mochi pull abc123xyz
# Creates: your-deck-name-abc123xyz.md

# 4. Clean up duplicates with AI
mochi-mochi dedupe your-deck-name-abc123xyz.md

# 5. Edit cards however you want
vim your-deck-name-abc123xyz.md

# 6. Push your curated deck back to Mochi
mochi-mochi push your-deck-name-abc123xyz.md
```

That's it! Your deck is now curated and synced. 🎉

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install
uv tool install git+https://github.com/tsilva/mochi-mochi.git

# Update
uv tool upgrade mochi-mochi

# Uninstall
uv tool uninstall mochi-mochi
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+ • `requests>=2.25.0` • `openai>=1.0.0` (for dedupe)

---

## 🔑 Configuration

On first run, you'll be prompted for your Mochi API key (get it from [settings](https://app.mochi.cards/settings)). It's saved to `~/.mochi-mochi/config` automatically.

**Optional:** For the `dedupe` command, you'll also need an OpenAI API key (get it from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)). You'll be prompted when first running `dedupe`.

Manual config file format:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.mochi-mochi
cat > ~/.mochi-mochi/config << EOF
MOCHI_API_KEY=your_mochi_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
EOF
```

---

## 💻 Usage

**Curation Workflow:** Pull → Dedupe → Edit → Commit → Push (or Sync)

### 🔍 Find and Remove Duplicates

```bash
mochi-mochi dedupe <deck-file>.md                 # Find semantic duplicates
mochi-mochi dedupe <deck-file>.md --threshold 0.9 # Stricter matching
```

Uses OpenAI embeddings to find semantically similar cards. Interactive prompt lets you choose which to keep. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in config (prompted on first use).

### 🔄 Sync Operations

```bash
mochi-mochi decks                        # List all decks
mochi-mochi pull <deck_id>               # Download deck to <name>-<id>.md
mochi-mochi push <deck-file>.md          # One-way sync: local → remote (fails if remote cards deleted)
mochi-mochi sync <deck-file>.md          # Bidirectional sync: handles remote deletions
mochi-mochi push <deck-file>.md --force  # Push without duplicate detection
```

**Push vs Sync:**
- **`push`**: One-way sync (local → remote). Best for daily updates. Raises an error if cards exist locally but were deleted remotely, protecting you from data inconsistencies.
- **`sync`**: Bidirectional sync that handles remote deletions. If cards are deleted remotely, they're removed from your local file after confirmation. Use when you've deleted cards in Mochi and want to sync those deletions locally.

### 📚 Managing Multiple Decks

```bash
mkdir ~/my-flashcards && cd ~/my-flashcards && git init
mochi-mochi pull abc123 && mochi-mochi pull def456
git add . && git commit -m "Initial decks"
# Dedupe, edit, commit, then push individual decks as needed
```

## 📝 Card Format

Cards are markdown with frontmatter, separated by `---`:

```markdown
---
card_id: abc123
tags: ["python", "basics"]
---
What is a list comprehension?
---
A concise way to create lists in Python using [x for x in iterable]
---
card_id: null
---
What is a dictionary?
---
A key-value data structure
```

**Frontmatter fields:**
- `card_id`: Mochi ID (`null` for new cards)
- `tags`: JSON array (optional)
- `archived`: Set to `true` to archive (optional)

**Sync behavior:**
- **push**: Existing cards (with IDs) are updated, new cards (`card_id: null`) are created, fails if local cards were deleted remotely
- **sync**: Same as push, but also removes locally any cards that were deleted remotely (with confirmation)
- Duplicate detection prevents copies (use `--force` to bypass)
